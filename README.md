This repository is dedicated to teaching simulations. For this reason some examples will be in form of modules and will require compiling Godot Engine. This information will be stated in each example.

## Examples:
Objective of each example is to illustrate selected simulation topics and how to implement it.
Each example have 2 versions: <b>starting</b> with framework for implementation and <b> final</b> containing actual implementation.

### [conservation_of_momentum](/final/conservation_of_momentum)
Introduction to simulation by implementing conservation of momentum.
